### Links

- Live Site URL: [Huddle Landing Page With Curved Sections](https://huddle-landing-page-curved-sections-frontend.netlify.app/)

## My process
This challenged myself for three days and somewhat I want the layout to be exact as the design. My SCSS was kind of messy because of the media queries and each day was making sure the responsiveness and the sizes of the elements but as long as I learned, making pixel perfect is a bonus. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learning the responsiveness of properties and images even though not using media queries. Still learning on how I can improve my media queries.
